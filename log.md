# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Found new parameters and return values for API function calls being made from before. Updated those calls to allow the basic functionality of the addon to work again.

**Thoughts:** While fixing this, I came up with several "enhancements" to the addon such as a menu with a available list of realms with check boxes to allow the user to mark which realms to auto decline.

### Day 1: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Updated the addon to not trigger when in a LFG group. Started adding the functionality to not run the addon logic if you are not party/raid leader. Found new functions to use to gather needed data to determine instance character is currently in. Use that data to determine the logic mentioned earlier

**Thoughts** Learned about some new WoW API functions to gain data that I don't really need, but it was cool to see some of the return values.
